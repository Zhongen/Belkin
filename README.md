[Kaggle Belkin Energy Disaggregation Competition](http://www.kaggle.com/c/belkin-energy-disaggregation-competition)

This is the first project I used python for data analysis.  Worked on during summer 2013
Programs in first level directory were used for data exploration.  Programs under Main were used to aggregate data and run data mining procedures.
